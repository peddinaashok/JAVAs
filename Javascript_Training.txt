I/o facility in Javascrpit is done by NodeJS.

NodeJS -> Backend processing , security also


JS code works in IE then it can work in any browser.


DOM(document object model) follows Tree structure.

Need for project:
------------------
1. Identify JS version

Security:
------------------
1. Script Injections _> can insert eval() function and can destory ur browser.
Ans:  Antisamy rules


Object based language -> Injheritance is not supported so we need to use prototyping object mapping and it is browser
dependent so it is better to use((es6/typescript)/coffee script/dart)

exa: import/export/arrow functions/arrays for Angular


Migrating form version to new version we need to use babel(transpiler)

Dependency -> To fufil the task which can not be done by core functionality tools-> npm/(yarn(app.json/package.json))

ECMA version 


1. datatypes
2. loops
3. conditional stmts
4. sbi
5. js function concepts
6. es6 features
7. typescript
8. object js api


=== -> check data type and value- Deep comparator
== -> shallow comparator



js supports iterators
